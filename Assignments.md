Hi All,

We have listed down some excercises to evaluate our skills in C/Linux development. (You may combine the following excercises)

File Handling:
1) Write a code to insert a line in middle of file
2) Create three threads to write to same file
3) Write a code to print the file size and Copy the file
4) Write a code to read/write the files using open()/close() instead of fopen()/fclose()

Pointers:
1) Show a demo for "Constant Pointer" vs "Pointer Constant"
2) Show a demo for "Call by Reference" vs "Call by Value"
3) Show a demo for "void *" de-referencing for int/char*
4) Show a demo for "function pointer" and call different functions using same function pointer.

Strings:
1) Store an array of strings in both ARRAY and POINTERS
2) Parse a comma separate string and print all values (i.e number of comma separated fields is dynamic)

Algorithms:
1) Write a code to demo "Singly/Doubly Linked List"
2) Write a code to demo "FIFO/LIFO"
3) Wrie a code to demo "Sorting" for integer & strings

IPC:
1) Write a code for client & server communication using sockets 
  (i.e Server will send variable length of string and Client should able to read & print variable length strings)
  (i.e Please embed the variable length string inside a struct and send it over Socket)
2) Write a code to demo "netlink" IPC
3) Write a code to demo "Pipes" IPC
4) Write a code to demo "MsgQueue" IPC

Thread/Process:
1) Demo a multhreaded application with mutex/semaphore
2) Show a demo on "How to share variable/data b/w multiple process"?
